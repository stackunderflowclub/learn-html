		<h1>This is a level 1 heading.</h1>
		<h2>This is a level 2 subheading.</h2>
		...
		<h6>It goes all the way down to level 6.</h6>
		Header elements are <strong>semantic elements</strong>, meaning they have a
		special meaning in the markup. Headings are used for structuring, especially
		by screen readers, "reading mode" programs, and other document-parsing
		programs. Never use header tags to change text size! That can be
		accomplished later with styling using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
		<p>
			This is a paragraph element.
			<br />
			That was a line break, created by the &lt;br /&gt; element.
			<br />To render special characters which HTML parses, such as &lt; and
			&gt;, you can use escape sequences. They start with an &amp; and end with
			a semicolon, with their abbreviation in between. For example, "&lt;br
			/&gt;" was created with this: "&amp;lg;br /&amp;gt;" To escape the &amp;
			and make it appear normally, you can use the escape sequence "&amp;amp;"
